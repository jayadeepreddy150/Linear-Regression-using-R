# Linear-Regression-using-R

1.	Load Boston.cvs data set. It records 14 variables for 506 neighborhoods around Boston:


2.	Fit a multiple regression model to predict the response variable medv using all other variables. For which variables the corresponding regression coefficients are likely to be significant? (40 points)

3.	On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a smaller linear regression model that only uses predictors for which there is evidence of association with medv. (10 points)

4.	How well the models in 2 and 3 fit the data? (10 points)


5.	Try to reduce the set of predictors by making correlation and scatterplot matrices and fit even a smaller model using the predictors of your choice. (30 points)


6.	Investigate possible interactions between the variables in the last model. Try to find a model with the maximum of R2 value (10 points)
